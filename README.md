# Simple Progress Bar in Vanilla JavaScript

A simple progress bar that I created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. No need for a framework or a library!

To use it, all you need to do is initialize the variable "numQuestionsCompleted" to whatever value you want -- make sure it's a non-negative number that is less than or equal to NUM_QUESTIONS -- and the progress bar will reflect the "question progress" visually.

Thanks for checking out my repo!
